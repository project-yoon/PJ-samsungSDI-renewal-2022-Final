					<p>
						The purpose of this Guidelines is to establish reasonable and fair trading practices by presenting matters to be observed in signing 
						contracts between Samsung SDI (hereinafter “the Company”) and partner suppliers (hereinafter “supplier”) in order to ensure that 
						suppliers with insufficient bargaining power can properly reflect their interests in signing contracts with us and to prevent us from 
						hindering the principle of freedom of contract by abusing superior bargaining power in transactions with partners.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="terms_txt">
					<h4 class="titsub1B">2. Composition of the Guidelines</h4>
					<p>
						The Guidelines herein consists of a) Contracting Infrastructure that we must build before signing a contract, b) Contracting with 
						Guaranteed Self-Determination that presents desirable matters to be included by contracting parties in a situation where self-
						determination is guaranteed, and c) Faithful Contract Performance under Contracts and Related Laws that present matters to be 
						observed in contract performance.
